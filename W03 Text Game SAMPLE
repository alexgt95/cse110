# Adventure Game: The Quest for the Crystal Compass
# Shared with two friends who enjoyed the variety of outcomes.
# They suggested adding a hidden path, so I added a secret keyword option!
# They were curious how the nested if-statements worked, and I showed them how the choices determine the story.
